1.if else loop 

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")


2.one line statement 
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

3.short hand if else 
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")


4.if with multiple statements (ternary operator)
a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

5.if with and :  The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")


6.if with or :  The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")


7.if with not:  The not keyword is a logical operator, and is used to reverse the result of the conditional statement:
a = 33
b = 200
if not a > b:
  print("a is NOT greater than b")

8.nested if : if statement inside if statement : 
x = 41
if x > 10:
  print("Above ten,")
  if x > 20:
    print("and also above 20!")
  else:
    print("but not above 20.")

9.the pass statement: where if statement is empty then use this.
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  pass
