1.Print in Python - Directly can do it in the command line - 
print("Hello, World!")


2. Identation in Python ::
if 5>2 
  print("Five is greater than two")

note: identation is required
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

3.Python Variables ::

x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
print(y)

note: Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

4. What is Casting in Python ?
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

5. You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

=> 
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>


6. What are single or double quotes ?

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'

7.Variables are case sensitive-

This will create two variables:

a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a

8.What are Variable names and rules ????

Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

Legal variable names:

myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

........................................................................


9.What are multi word variable names :: 

1.CamelCase: 
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"

2.Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"

3.Snake Case 
Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"

........................................................................

10.Many Values to Multiple Variables?
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.

........................................................................

11.One Value to Multiple Variables?
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

........................................................................


12.Unpack a Collection?

If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

........................................................................

13. Python - Output Variables

The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)  

Print Function to Print One Value ::
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

Print Function to Print Multiple Value ::
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

OR


x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

OR

In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

note - it will give errors because data types are different 

........................................................................

14.Python Global Variables ::

Global Variables
Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.

Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.


Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()

DATA TYPES IN PYTHON ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:  str
Numeric Types:  int, float, complex
Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
Mapping Type: dict
Set Types:  set, frozenset
Boolean Type: bool
Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:  NoneType


................................


Setting the Data Type
In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

Example Data Type Try it
x = "Hello World" str 
x = 20  int 
x = 20.5  float 
x = 1j  complex 
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] list  
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") tuple 
x = range(6)  range 
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36} dict  
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} set 
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})  frozenset 
x = True  bool  
x = b"Hello"  bytes 
x = bytearray(5)  bytearray 
x = memoryview(bytes(5))  memoryview  
x = None  NoneType


................................

Setting the Specific Data Type
If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:

Example Data Type Try it
x = str("Hello World")  str 
x = int(20) int 
x = float(20.5) float 
x = complex(1j) complex 
x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) list  
x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  tuple 
x = range(6)  range 
x = dict(name="John", age=36) dict  
x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  set 
x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  frozenset 
x = bool(5) bool  
x = bytes(5)  bytes 
x = bytearray(5)  bytearray 
x = memoryview(bytes(5))  memoryview  


................................


What is tuple in python ::::: 

Tuple. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
