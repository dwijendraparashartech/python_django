1.what is django ?

Django is a free and open-source web application framework written in Python. It is used for rapid web development and clean, pragmatic design. It is built by experienced developers to make repetitive tasks easier, so we can focus on writing apps instead of reinventing the wheel.

Views are usually put in a file called views.py located on your app's folder.
